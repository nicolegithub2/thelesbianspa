                            <p>A woman wants to feel a bond when she makes love to another human being; and in a relationship that involves two women making love to each other, the need of feeling a connection becomes even more important. This is where the lesbian tantra jumps in. 
<br>Lesbian tantra consists of two words and a very deep meaning. Lesbian refers to the women who feel attracted and fall in love with another woman, and tantra is an ancient Sanskrit word which means magic. When the two words combine, it gives rise to a metaphor which is used for all the feelings and connections that a lesbian couples aims to have in the relationship. This does not just means sharing an honest bond and a pure heart, it also means feeling each other in the mental and physical state in the ways that are nothing short of godlike and heavenly. Tantra is a word that is used to describe magic that is strong and powerful and that is the kind of magic women look for in their relationship as well. If there is any relationship that aptly defines the meaning of tantra, it has to be the one between two women.
<br>Achieving lesbian tantra is anything but hard. A couple just needs to feel each other, admire each other and trust each other. With all these three qualities flowing freely into a relationship, there is nothing that can stop the magic from happening. Another important part of tantra in a relationship is the presence of a mutual understanding and fulfilling the desires of each other. To know the likes and dislikes of the other person is as important as knowing the desires and needs of your own body. To achieve a heavenly love, one has to dwell deep into each other, look at the soul, admire the character and only then can one hope to achieve the magic.
<br>Many people believe that being satisfied in a relationship is all that is needed. However, this is just half the truth. Satisfaction is what keeps you in the relationship but if you are not aiming to please each other every day of your life, you are losing a part of your relationship every single day. The concept of Lesbian tantra involves bonding in a way that is more than just showering your partner with unconditional love. It deals with making your partner feel sexually wanted. It involves aligning your heart, mind and soul in a single line and devoting them to the service of your partner. Lesbian tantra requires one to play and balance the masculine as well as the feminine energies of the world around you. Women find it hard to cop up with change in energies inside them but with practice and determination, this can become easy. All you need to think about is the happiness that your efforts can bring to your partner; and soon, that is all that will matter.
<br>Breath in sync, let the emotions and sex flow, let yourself be free and let your partner explore the wild. With the muscles moving together and the bodies aligning in the same direction, you will notice that you two will slowly uncover the mystery of lesbian tantra.<br></p>

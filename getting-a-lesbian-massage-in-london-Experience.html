                            <p>I have always been an adventurous person full of adrenaline, gusto and the willingness to try just about anything new and dare I say, sexy. So, it was with great anticipation that I booked a session for a lesbian massage with a tantric massage palour in London after coming across information via a website. I had never been with another female nor had the inclination to 'go both ways' but something about feeling another woman's body next to mine slowly turned me on. After all, this was going to be another adventure to savour.
<br>Choosing London as a holiday destination was not that hard. I'd heard so much about the city and my little mischievous appointment gave me so much to look up to. Having gone through the website, I settled for a buxom brunette called Becky. The time was set for 6pm and every minute that elapsed left me all the more curious and eager. I was going to get touched by a woman! I mean, what did I know about lesbian massage or tantric lesbian massage? I wasn't scared. No. But every part of me quaked with sweet tension.
<br>I arrived the Palour and was immediately ushered into a well-furnished and moderately lit room filled with sensual scents and a comfy table. As I waited, a slight knock on the door interrupted my jangled thoughts. I proceeded to open the door and there before me, stood a wonderfully sculpted figure with the most charming eyes I'd ever seen. Becky was dressed in a silk robe and all other accessories that barely did enough to hide her luscious figure.
<br>We both sat and chatted for a while and I could have sworn that I had more attraction for her than I did for my last boyfriend. Perhaps, already sensing my eagerness, Becky asked me to strip bare after I'd taken a shower. A Phil Collins song gently oozed from a stereo.
<br>Becky asked me to sit on the table at first. She began a little strip-tease. Taking off the silk robe and gently peeling off her bra, revealing firm well-rounded breasts. As I watched her, my core began to have sensations. When she was totally naked, she asked me to lie face down on the massage table. She began massaging my body. Caressing every part. Behind my legs, my bum, lower back. Everywhere. It was an earth-shaking.
<br>Becky then asked me to flip upwards while she took a little jar of massage oil and began to pour it on herself. I watched with bated breath as the oil cascaded down her twin towers of firm flesh. She asked me to again lie face down. She slid and glided over my back and bum sensually and erotically.
<br>My body began to yield to the fervor and delightful strokes of her breast against my back. I struggled within me not to reach out and cup them. I softly moaned at every brush and touch and wondered how much pleasure lesbian massage made me feel.
<br>Becky gently spun me over and as our eyes locked in a stare, I said yes to an unasked question. She poured some warm oil on my chest and upper belly and gently smooths her gifted hands over my nipples which stood erect and villainous. I could barely contain my excitement as I moaned with blissful pleasure.
<br>I marveled at Becky's expertise and whispered her name as unashamedly felt my core with my own hand. She gently put it aside and poured more massage oil on my chest. This time she focused on my neck and shoulders. It was a strangely sweet feeling. One I never knew could manifest, but for the wonderful hands of Becky. By this time, I was totally unafraid. Fueled by desires of lust and brazen adventure, I reached for her full breasts and gently caressed them. I was taken aback by how huge they were and fun to stroke.
<br>Becky didn't resist. It was all too much for both of us. I kept stroking and feeling my way around her body. It was sensually invigorating. She poured a little oil on my belly button and slid her cute hands gently till it reached near my core. I could barely contain myself and knew my lesbian massage in London was about to get a whole lot better. I spun my hips as ecstasy consumed every fiber of my being. I could see she was also fully turned on and My eyes beckoned for more as searched hers.
<br>She took the little jar of massage oil and poured some on my Chest, belly, and thighs. She proceeded to lie to me and we rocked slight movements as our intertwined bodies strove for best angles to maximize pleasure. I moved my hands over her lower back and bum as we locked lips for the first time. It was a wonderful feeling. Becky moved her body ever so gracefully across mine as she stuck to her massage routine. Her touch was supernatural and the warmth her body conveyed left me needing more.
<br>We put our legs in between each other's and slowly ground our pelvis. Our breasts glistened with oil as they glided over each other with nipples creating points of references. It was an entanglement of wholesome connection. Becky was every inch the perfect masseuse. Here for my enjoyment and pleasure. A lesbian massage went right.
<br>After some minutes Becky focused on my core. She rubbed and smooths the outer parts with her soft hands. This made my body shake with pleasure as I experienced an orgasm. She smiled and asked me to flip back on my belly. Awesome feelings crept through every part of me while she stroked my inner thighs and my lower back. It dawned on me how much time flies when one is having a truly amazing experience. 
<br>Numbed with blissful excitement, I silently thanked the gods for yet another glorious adventure I couldn't wait to share.
